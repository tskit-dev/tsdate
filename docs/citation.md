The algorithm for the `inside_outside` and `maximization` methods is described
in [our Science paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi8264) (citation below,
preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.431497v2)).
[Another repository](https://github.com/awohns/unified_genealogy_paper) provides
code to reproduce evaluations of the accuracy and computational requirements of these methods.
The default `variational_gamma` method has not yet been described in print. For the moment,
please cite this github repository if you need a citable reference.

The original _tsdate_ algorithm, which you should cite in published work, is published in:

        (i.e. normalised genomic spans) sum to one, and are used to construct
        the mixed conditional coalescent prior. For each coalescent node, the

        nodes (or "tips") ( :math:`T` ) in the tree(s) covered by this node,

        ``u`` is present in a tree of ``T`` total samples with exactly ``k``
        samples descending from the node. Although ``k`` may take any value
        from 2 up to ``T``, the values are likely to be very sparse, and many
        values of both ``T`` and ``k`` are likely to be missing from the
        returned weights. For example, if there are no trees in which the node

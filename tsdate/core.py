    Infer dates for nodes in a genealogical graph using the "outside maximization"
    algorithm. This approximates the marginal posterior distribution of a node's
    age using an atomic discretization of time (e.g. point masses at particular
    timepoints).

    This estimation method comprises a single "inside" step followed by an
    "outside maximization" step. The inside step passes backwards in time from the
    samples to the roots of the graph,taking account of the distributions of times of
    each node's child (and if a ``mutation_rate`` is given, the the number of mutations
    on each edge). The outside maximization step passes forwards in time from the roots,
    updating each node's time on the basis of the most likely timepoint for
    each parent of that node. This provides a reasonable point estimate for node times,
    but does not generate a true posterior time distribution.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

      new_ts = tsdate.maximization(ts, mutation_rate=1e-8, population_size=1e4)

    .. note::
        The prior parameters for each node-to-be-dated take the form of probabilities
        for each node at a set of discrete timepoints. If the ``priors`` parameter is
        used, it must specify an object constructed using :func:`build_prior_grid`
        (this can be used to define the number and position of the timepoints).
        If ``priors`` is not used, ``population_size`` must be provided,
        which is used to create a default prior derived from the conditional coalescent
        (tilted according to population size and weighted by the genomic
        span over which a node has a given number of descendant samples). This default
        prior assumes the nodes to be dated are all the non-sample nodes in the input
        tree sequence, and that they are contemporaneous.

    :param ~tskit.TreeSequence tree_sequence: The input tree sequence to be dated.
    :param float mutation_rate: The estimated mutation rate per unit of genome per
        unit time. If provided, the dating algorithm will use a mutation rate clock to
        help estimate node dates. Default: ``None``
    :param float or ~demography.PopulationSizeHistory population_size: The estimated
        (diploid) effective population size used to construct the (default) conditional
        coalescent prior. For a population with constant size, this can be given as a
        single value (for example, as commonly estimated by the observed genetic
        diversity of the sample divided by four-times the expected mutation rate).
        Alternatively, for a population with time-varying size, this can be given
        directly as a :class:`~demography.PopulationSizeHistory` object or a parameter
        dictionary passed to initialise a :class:`~demography.PopulationSizeHistory`
        object. The ``population_size`` parameter is only used when ``priors`` is
        ``None``. Conversely, if ``priors`` is not ``None``, no ``population_size``
        value should be specified.
    :param tsdate.node_time_class.NodeTimeValues priors: NodeTimeValues object containing
        the prior parameters for each node-to-be-dated. Note that different estimation
        methods may require different types of prior, as described in the documentation
        for each estimation method.
    :param float eps: The error factor in time difference calculations, and the
        minimum distance separating parent and child ages in the returned tree sequence.
        Default: None, treated as 1e-6.
    :param int num_threads: The number of threads to use when precalculating likelihoods.
        A simpler unthreaded algorithm is used unless this is >= 1. Default: None
    :param string probability_space: Should the internal algorithm save

    :param \\**kwargs: Other keyword arguments as described in the :func:`date` wrapper

    Infer dates for nodes in a genealogical graph using the "inside outside" algorithm.
    This approximates the marginal posterior distribution of a node's age using an
    atomic discretization of time (e.g. point masses at particular timepoints).

    Currently, this estimation method comprises a single "inside" followed by a similar

    roots of the graph,taking account of the distributions of times of each node's child
    (and if a ``mutation_rate`` is given, the the number of mutations on each edge).
    The outside step passes forwards in time from the roots, incorporating the time
    distributions for each node's parents. If there are (undirected) cycles in the
    underlying graph, this method does not provide a theoretically exact estimate
    of the marginal posterior distribution of node ages, but in practice it
    results in an accurate approximation.

        and are using the conditional coalescent prior, the ``population_size``
        value which you provide must be scaled by multiplying by the number of
        years per generation. If ``None`` (default), assume ``"generations"``.
    :param string method: What estimation method to use. See
        :data:`~tsdate.core.estimation_methods` for possible values.
        If ``None`` (default) the "variational_gamma" method is currently chosen.
    :param int constr_iterations: The maximum number of constrained least
        squares iterations to use prior to forcing positive branch lengths.
        Default: None, treated as 0.
    :param bool set_metadata: Should unconstrained times be stored in table metadata,
        in the form of ``"mn"`` (mean) and ``"vr"`` (variance) fields? If ``False``,
        do not store metadata.  If ``True``, force metadata to be set (if no schema
        is set or the schema is incompatible, clear existing metadata in the relevant
        tables and set a new schema). If ``None`` (default), only set metadata if
        the existing schema allows (this may overwrite existing ``"mn"`` and ``"vr"``
        fields) or if existing metadata is empty, otherwise issue a warning.
    :param bool return_fit: If ``True``, instead of just a dated tree sequence,
        return a tuple of ``(dated_ts, fit)``. Default: None, treated as False.
    :param bool return_likelihood: If ``True``, return the log marginal likelihood
        from the inside algorithm in addition to the dated tree sequence. If
        ``return_fit`` is also ``True``, then the marginal likelihood
        will be the last element of the tuple. Default: None, treated as False.
    :param bool allow_unary: Allow nodes that are "locally unary" (i.e. have only
        one child in one or more local trees). Default: None, treated as False.
    :param bool progress: Show a progress bar. Default: None, treated as False.
    :param bool record_provenance: Should the tsdate command be appended to the
        provenence information in the returned tree sequence?
        Default: None, treated as True.
    :param \\**kwargs: Other keyword arguments specific to the
        :data:`estimation method<tsdate.core.estimation_methods>` used. These are
        documented in those specific functions.
    :return:
        A copy of the input tree sequence but with updated node times, or (if
        ``return_fit`` or ``return_likelihood`` is True) a tuple of that
        tree sequence plus a fit object and/or the
        marginal likelihood given the mutations on the tree sequence.

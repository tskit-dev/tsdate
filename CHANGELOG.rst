--------------------
[0.1.6] - ****-**-**
--------------------

**Features**

- Historical samples can now be incorporated directly into the dating framework.
  This is done by constructing a bespoke prior grid using
  ``grid=tsdate.build_prior_grid(..., allow_historical_samples=True`` and
  passing that into ``tsdate.date``. It is also possible to set a variance for
  historial sample nodes.

**Breaking changes**

- The standalone ``preprocess_ts`` function now defaults to not removing unreferenced
  individuals, populations, or sites, aiming to change the tree sequence tables as
  little as possible.

--------------------
[0.1.5] - 2022-06-07
--------------------

**Features**

- Added the ``time_units`` parameter to ``tsdate.date``, allowing users to specify
  the time units of the dated tree sequence. Default is ``"generations"``.
- Added the ``return_posteriors`` parameter to ``tsdate.date``. If True, the function
  returns a tuple of ``(dated_ts, posteriors)``.
- ``mutation_rate`` is now a required argument in ``tsdate.date`` and ``tsdate.get_dates``
- tsdate returns an error if users attempt to date an unsimplified tree sequence.
- Updated tsdate citation information to cite the recent Science paper
- Built wheel on Python 3.10


--------------------
[0.1.4] - 2021-06-30
--------------------

**Features**

- The algorithm now operates completely in unscaled time (in units of generations) under
  the hood, which means that ``tsdate.build_prior_grid`` now requires the parameter
  ``Ne``.
- Users now have access to the marginal posterior distributions on node age by running 
  ``tsdate.get_dates``, though this is undocumented for now.

**Bugfixes**

- A fix to the way likelihoods are added should eliminate numerical errors that are
  sometimes encountered when dating very large tree sequences.

--------------------
[0.1.3] - 2021-02-15
--------------------

**Features**

- Two new methods, ``tsdate.sites_time_from_ts`` and ``tsdate.add_sampledata_times``, 
  support inference of tree sequences from non-contemporaneous samples.
- New tutorial on inferring tree sequences from modern and historic/ancient samples 
  explains how to use these functions in conjunction with ``tsinfer``.
- ``tsdate.preprocess_ts`` supports dating inferred tree sequences which include large, 
  uninformative stretches (i.e. centromeres and telomeres). Simply run this function 
  on the tree sequence before dating it.
- ``ignore_outside`` is a new parameter in the outside pass which tells ``tsdate`` to 
  ignore edges from oldest root (these edges are often of low quality in ``tsinfer``
  inferred tree sequences)
- Development environment is now equivalent to other ``tskit-dev`` projects


--------------------
[0.1.2] - 2020-02-28
--------------------

- Improve user experience with more progress bars and logging.
- Slightly change traversal method in outside and outside maximization algorithms,
  this should only affect inference on inferred tree sequences with large numbers 
  of nodes at the same frequency.
- Improve reporting of current project version
- Use appdirs for default caching location
- Prevent dating tree sequences with dangling nodes


--------------------
[0.1.1] - 2020-02-25
--------------------

Bugfix release: resolve issue with precalculating prior values.


--------------------
[0.1.0] - 2020-02-24
--------------------

Early Alpha release made available via PyPI for community testing and evaluation.
